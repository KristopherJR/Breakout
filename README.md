<h1>How to Play</h1>
Use the Arrow Keys Left and Right to move the Paddle. Bounce the ball off the Paddle to hit the bricks. Hitting bricks will increase your score and break them, the goal is to break all of the bricks in order to win. You have 5 lives, if you miss the ball you will lose a life.<p>

You can manipulate the ball by moving the paddle when the ball collides with it. If the paddle is in motion, the angle the ball reflects of the paddle is altered. Use this to aim the ball.
